## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to use Javascript add text in the code when a user selects or rates with a given number and display the selected ratings.

```js
spanValue = e.target.textContent;
rating.textContent = `You selected ${spanValue} out of 5`;
```

### Continued development

I would focus more on learning Javascript to be better.
